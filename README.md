# Dataset for FakeCovid

This github repository corresponds dataset used for our research article titled **FakeCovid- A Multilingual Cross-domain Fact Check News Dataset for COVID-19**.

FakeCovid is the first multilingual cross-domain dataset of 7623 fact-checked news articles for COVID-19, collected from 04/01/2020 to 01/07/2020. We have collected the fact-checked articles from 92 fact-checking websites after obtaining references from Poynter and Snopes. We have manually annotated the collected articles into 11 categories of the fact-checked news according to their content. The ultimately generated dataset is in 40 languages from 105 countries.

The work has been accepted in the Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2020)(http://cysoc.aiisc.ai/) at 14th International Conference on Web and Social Media 2020.
