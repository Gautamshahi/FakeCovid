FakeCovid is the first multilingual cross-domain dataset of 7623 fact-checked news articles for COVID-19, collected from 04/01/2020 to 01/07/2020. We have collected the fact-checked articles from 92 fact-checking websites after obtaining references from Poynter and Snopes. We have manually annotated the collected articles into 11 categories of the fact-checked news according to their content. The ultimately generated dataset is in 40 languages from 105 countries.
